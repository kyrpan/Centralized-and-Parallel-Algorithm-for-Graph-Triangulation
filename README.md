The main concept of this work is counting the number of triangles in a graph. Counting triangles is attracting increasing interest in studying social networks (Facebook, Twitter etc.), in the creation of successful spam filters and many more. In this work, two counting algorithms are examined for their time performance in massive networks. The first one is sequential and is called NodeIteratorN and the second, Patric, is parallel.
